# Mberdle
Worlde on an mbed

This was created as a final project for one of my classes. I took an mbed, connected it to an LCD screen, buttons, a gyroscope, and speaker.
I then wrote some code to connect them all together and programmed the popular game "Wordle" onto the mbed. Compared to the original game
I went beyond to include a leaderboard, animations, multiple difficulties, as well as gyroscopic controls.
